I wrote this project for a [Udemy web development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). It's a game of Simon written using jQuery. You can play it online at https://s-simon.netlify.app/.

It's not particularly impressive in terms of coding style; I put this on GitHub so I could quickly reference this project should I need to in the future.
